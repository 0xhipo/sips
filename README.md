# Sui Improvement Proposals (SIPs)

## What is SIP?

SIP stands for Sui Improvement Proposal. A SIP is a design document that details a new feature for Sui, its processes, or the ecosystem. It provides the basis for the Sui community to propose a new idea and to assess its merits, its feasability and the implementation details.
